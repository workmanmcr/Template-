## **Description**

Node is a template repo for a basic Node.js project, outfitted with a bundler, linter, javascript converter, compiler for typescript, and test package. The file structure consists of the config files in the root, along with package.json for setup, and the folders, _ _ tests _ _ containing test files, credits, and src containing the development files. There is one sample test file in the tests folder, whereas src consists of assets, css and js with index.js and index.html.

The credit folder is a personal preference for keeping track of the origins of resources, particularly their READMEs and attribution details, often consisting of author or organization name, url, and title of the resource. If the resource was renamed, include the rename to attributions.

When the build command is run, a dist directory will be created, and when the start command is run, launching a preview of the site, both a dist and coverage directories will be created. The dist will contain the production files for the website, app or api, while the coverage will save the results of running the test suites in jest.

Assets is for images and fonts. It contains two subdirectories, img and fonts, both containing samples, the latter possessing a selection: Bebas Neue, League Spartan, Muli, Nunito Sans, Oswald, Ovo, and Ra Mono. All of these fonts are either public domain or open source. Css is for stylesheets, and contains two sample files, fonts.css and styles.css. The present styles in the latter are derived from Skeleton 2.0.4 by Dave Gamache. Js is for interaction and functionality, and has two subdirectories, bs for business logic and ui for user interface logic.

## **Complete Setup**

- Navigate to main page of repo
- Above file list, click **Use this template**
- Dropdown: select **Create a new repository**
- Fill out create repo form

### **Local Setup**

- Navigate to your new repo
- Clone it

```bash
git clone .../.git
git pull origin main
```

The git pull command is only if necessary, such as choosing to add a README or LICENSE file when filling out the create repo form. You may encounter conflicts, since this template already comes with a README and LICENSE.

Optionally, you can remove .DS_Store from .gitignore, if you are not using a Mac.

**Do not forget:**

- Remove unwanted fonts from assets/fonts
- Remove sample img from assets/img

### **Change project references**

package.json
- Line 2 project name

webpack.config.js
- Line 23 title in HtmlWebpackPlugin

README.md
- Line 1 title of project
- Line 3 developer(s) of project
- Line 7 username and repo name in link

index.html
- Line 6 title in head

Change this readme to reflect your project's purpose and setup. Also, do not forget to change the copyright. It's best to produce a license when creating the repo, hence the initial pull.

### **Change imports, exports and component files and tests**

Component.js is just a sample. Rename it and use it to contain just the logic of a single component. Components can be seen as handlers of an object, feature, or state.

Component.test.js is just a sample with a single test and describe. Each component should have a corresponding test file with the same name, but with an extension of .test.js, and the test file should only test the functionality of its corresponding component. Make sure you're importing what is needed for it to run.

## **Features**

To run the test suite, use the command ```npm run test``` in the terminal. You can also use ```npx jest```.

To create the production ready code for your project, use the command ```npm run build``` in the terminal.

To build and preview your project, use either ```npm run start``` or ```npm start``` in the terminal.

To type in typescript:
- name files with .ts instead of .js
- run ```npx tsc <filename>.ts``` or ```npm run tsc``` to compile to javascript

**Warning**: Typescript feature has not been tested in use. I anticipate conflicts with the build command, but am not sure.

**Warning**: Unless there's at least one .ts file in your src folder, the tsconfig.json will output a problem, namely that there are no inputs. If you don't end up using TypeScript, remove Component.ts in src/js/bs/ and the tsconfig.json in root.

## **Rendering**

Before publishing your website, app, or api, change the rule, "no-console": "off", in .eslintrc to "no-console": "warn" and run ```npm run lint```

Also, remove any unused files or folders that came with this template.

**Github Pages**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Save final changes"
git push origin main
git checkout -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```

**To update Github Pages**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Save changes in main"
git push origin main
git checkout gh-pages
git merge main
git push origin gh-pages
```

### **How to render from dist/**

1. Remove dist/ from .gitignore

2.  
```bash
git add dist
git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
```

3.  
```bash
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```
